All these supplements are claimed to have significant healing effects. Different cultivation methods and extraction methods used for different Lingzhi products lead to the different concentration of active components which is essential for the beneficial effects of Lingzhi products. Therefore, it is important to check if the Lingzhi products you are taking are good. 
			In the past Dr. Zhang often recommended Lingzhi products to her clients, especially for elder people and also people with various cancers.
